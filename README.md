# falco

falco is VCL parser and linter optimized for [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com).

## Disclaimer

This is a VCL parser, but dedicate to Fastly's VCL (version 2.x), so we don't care about latest Varnish (7.x or later) syntax.
The Varnish may have additional syntax, builtin function, predefined variables, but this tool may not parse correctly.

Additionally, Fastly provides its special builtin functio, predefined variables. It's not compatibility for Varnish.
But this tool is optimized for them, we could parse and lint their declarations.

## Motivation

Fastly is really fantastic CDN, but sometimes we have problem for deployment operation.
On deploy custom VCL's to the Fastly, VCLs are validated when activate new service version.
Typically our deployment flow using custom VCLs is following:

1. Clone active service and create new version
2. Delete existing custom VCLs
3. Upload new VCL files to the Fastly
4. Activate new sevice version // <= Validate VCLs on the Fastly cloud

Above flows take a time, and then if we have some mistakes on VCL e.g. missing semicolon X(, the deployment will fail.
Additionally, unnecessary service version will be created by our trivial issue.

To solve them, we made Fastly dedicated VCL parser and linter tool to notice syntax error and unexpected mistakes before starting above deployment flow.

## Installation

Download binary from [releaes page](https://github.com/ysugimoto/falco/releases) according your platform and place under the `$PATH`.

## Usage

Command help displays following:

```shell
falco -h
=======================================
  falco: Fastly VCL parser / linter
=======================================
Usage:
    falco [main vcl file]

Flags:
    -I, --include_path : Add include path
    -t, --transformer  : Specify transformer
    -h, --help         : Show this help
    -V, --version      : Display build version
    -v,                : Verbose warning lint result
    -vv,               : Varbose all lint result

Example:
    falco -I . -vv /path/to/vcl/main.vcl
```

### Note:
Youe VCL will have dependent modules and loaded via `include [module]`. `falco` accept include path from `-I, --include_path` flag and search and load destination module from include path.

## User defined subroutine

On linting, `falco` could not recognize when the user-defined subroutine is called, so you should apply the subroutine scope by adding annotation or its subroutine name. falco understands call scope by following rules:

### Subroutine name

If subroutine name has suffix of `_[scope]`, falco lint within that scope.

```vcl
sub custom_recv { // name has `_recv` suffix, lint with RECV scope
  ...
}

sub custom_fetch { // name has `_fetch` suffix, lint with FETCH scope
  ...
}
```

Following table describes subroutine name and recognizing scope:

| suffix  | scope   | example               |
|:--------|:--------|:----------------------|
| _recv    | RECV    | sub custom_recv {}    |
| _miss    | MISS    | sub custom_miss {}    |
| _hash    | HASH    | sub custom_hash {}    |
| _pass    | PASS    | sub custom_pass {}    |
| _fetch   | FETCH   | sub custom_fetch {}   |
| _error   | ERROR   | sub custom_error {}   |
| _deliver | DELIVER | sub custom_deliver {} |
| _log     | LOG     | sub custom_log {}     |

### Annotation

Since project reason, subroutine name could not be changed. Then, if you apply a hint of scope on annotation, `falco` also understands scope:

```vcl
// @recv
sub custom_process { // subroutine has `recv` annotation, lint with RECV scope
  ...
}

// @fetch
sub custom_request { // subroutine has `fetch` annotation, lint with FETCH scope
  ...
}
```

Following table describes annotation name and recognizing scope:

| annotation  | scope   | example                      |
|:------------|:--------|:-----------------------------|
| @recv       | RECV    | // @recv<br>sub custom {}    |
| @miss       | MISS    | // @miss<br>sub custom {}    |
| @hash       | HASH    | // @hash<br>sub custom {}    |
| @pass       | PASS    | // @pass<br>sub custom {}    |
| @fetch      | FETCH   | // @fetch<br>sub custom {}   |
| @error      | ERROR   | // @error<br>sub custom {}   |
| @deliver    | DELIVER | // @deliver<br>sub custom {} |
| @log        | LOG     | // @log<br>sub custom {}     |

## Fastly related features

Currently, we don't support snippets which are managed in Fastly:

- Edge Dictionary
- VCL Snippets
- Log defnitions
- Etc

Above snippets will be injected to your VCL top or extracting `FASTLY XXX` macro, but this tool aims to run locally, not communicating with Fastly service.
However, we're planning to solve them using Fastly API.

## Lint error

`falco` has builtin lint rules. see [rules](https://github.com/ysugimoto/falco/blob/main/docs/rules.md) in detail.

## Error Levels

`falco` reports three of severity on linting:

### ERROR

VCL may cause error on Fastly, or may cause unexpected behavior for actual works.

### WARNING

VCL could work, but may have potencial bug and cause unexpected behavior for actual works.

`falco` does not output warnings as default. To see them, run with `-v` option.

### INFORMATION

VCL is fine, but we suggest to improve your VCL considering from Fastly recommendation.

`falco` does not output informations as default. To see them, run with `-vv` option.

## Tranforming

`falco` is planning to transpile Fastly VCL to the other programing language e.g Go (HTTP service), node.js (Lambda@Edge) to use temporal CDN instead of Fastly.
